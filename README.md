# example component matching module 
Learning fine-grained image similarity is a challenging task. It needs to capture between-class and within-class image differences. This Approach proposes a example component matching module that employs deep learning techniques to learn similarity metric directly from images.

we design the example component matching module to automatically select five example components asS the output.

Search-by-example, i.e. finding images that are similar to a query image, is an indispensable function for modern image search engines. An effective image similarity metric is at the core of finding similar images.
